This repo is a work in progress. It will eventually host the ongoing translation of Kumarājīva's *Commentary on the Large Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra* by Charles Patton. The English translation might never be completed, but a significant portion has been drafted and is being edited.

The Chinese source text can be found at CBETA: https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T1509_001
